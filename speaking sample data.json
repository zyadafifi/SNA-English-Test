On the day of the party, we told her we were just going to dinner. When she walked into the room and saw everyone, she was completely surprised. She started crying happy tears. Seeing her face light up made all the planning worth it. The party was a success and she said it was the best birthday she ever had.

      "topicText": "Talk about when a celebration didn't go as planned.",
      "sampleAnswer": "We planned an outdoor birthday party for my nephew, but heavy rain started just as guests arrived. Instead of canceling, we quickly moved everything inside the house. The space was much smaller and more crowded than we planned. We had to change all the outdoor games to indoor activities. At first, we were disappointed, but then something wonderful happened. Being in a small space together actually made the party more fun and intimate. Everyone helped move furniture and set up. We played card games and told stories instead of running around outside. The cozy atmosphere created more meaningful conversations. This experience taught me that celebrations are about being together, not perfect planning. Sometimes unexpected changes make events more memorable."

      "sampleAnswer": "At my great-aunt's eightieth birthday party, she taught us traditional songs from our culture. She explained that these songs were passed down through generations in our family. She told us the meaning behind each song and why they were important to our ancestors. We all learned to sing them together as a group. She also showed us traditional dances that went with the songs. I realized how much of our cultural heritage I did not know. The younger generation, including me, had never learned these songs. That day made me want to learn more about my culture and traditions. My great-aunt was happy to see us interested in preserving these traditions. Now our family sings these songs at every gathering."

      "topicText": "Explain why celebrations and festivals are important.",
      "sampleAnswer": "Celebrations and festivals are important for many reasons. First, they bring people together and create shared memories. When we celebrate, we strengthen our relationships with family and friends. Festivals help us maintain cultural traditions and pass them to younger generations. They give us reasons to take breaks from work and daily stress, allowing us to focus on what matters most. Celebrations mark important life events like births, marriages, and achievements. They provide moments of joy and happiness that we can remember during difficult times. Festivals also strengthen community bonds as neighbors and friends gather together. They remind us of our shared values and cultural identity. Without celebrations, life would be only work and routine. Celebrations add color, meaning, and joy to human existence."
